                <p>During my first trip to Sweden in 2018, I spent a lot of time in Gothenburg. I stayed with a family that treated me like family, in fact, 16 of us from LDC went and spent an extended weekend, from Thursday to Sunday, with this family. On our journey from Gothenburg airport to their house, which was around 3 hours drive away, I slept in the minivan and was awakened to the perception of a huge mooselike outline in the woods surrounding us. Nobody believed me until the driver turned around and went back, since he was a born in Sweden he knew there was a possibility I wasn't hallucinating. Everyone was shouting in amazement when they saw not one but two moose in the forest at around 2 am and that was just the beginning. Refugee witnessing, swimming, football, shopping, food and most important the association of the locals made this a trip of a lifetime.</p>

                <h3>2019 Trip</h3>
                <p>My second trip to Sweden was very fun and was a bit shorter than last time, this time I spent my time in Tranas with friends and we did a load more fun activities. We beat the locals at their own game, floorball, basically hockey and played a bit of football too while we were at it. After that, we went to a house next to a lake and had a barbeque, halloumi, bockwurst, burgers and condiments galore was what ensued of the course of that night. We also somehow ended up with one more person than we started with on the way back home so that was a logistical nightmare.</p>
