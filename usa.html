                <p>Landing in JFK was a logistical nightmare, it took more than 3 hours just to leave the airport. Once we got past border control we were greeted by a friend that I never met before and I was put in contact to through another friend. We ended getting the subway which was a nice experience especially because we got to see some brothers and sisters on the carts. We then spent the next three days in Warwick World Headquarters of Jehovah’s Witnesses as guests and visited the Patterson and Walkill branches as well. We also went to see a Knicks vs Kings game at Madison Square Garden which was the worst part of the trip. The Gilead student introductions was amazing, I would definitely go and see that again.</p>

                    <p>Once we Landed in LAX from JFK we needed to find our car rental because we were about to go on a 1000 mile road trip. When we got to the desk for our vehicle they said we were too young but once she ran the code through the system it all worked. We then met up with some friends at In-n-Out Burger just before it closed at 2 am. The burger was amazing and was exactly the quality I expected from an American fast-food restaurant.</p>
                    <li>San Francisco</li>
                    <p>We didn’t spend long at San Francisco because we had to catch a plane back to London but we managed to get on the wrong bridge and not have enough time to get to the Golden Gate Bridge. We got some famous clam chowder and then hop on our plane back to London.</p>
                </ul>

                <h3>Arizona</h3>
                <p>Phoenix, Arizona wasn’t a long stop off, went spend around 3 to 4 hours there. We stopped off at a little store just before we got to the Great Chasm. We are asked if the cashier knew anywhere good to get some food? And immediately an argument ensued between these to colleagues. Colourful language and aggressive threats were thrown around the place and then once it had all calmed down we got an answer. We drove to that recommended Mexican restaurant and sat down ready to be served. The restaurant turned out to be rubbish but when we got to the Great Chasm, wow, what a view. I mean how is something like that even formed.</p>
