                <h3>Famagusta</h3>
                <p>Famagusta used to be the biggest and well-built up part Cyprus until an invasion by Turkey claiming that it belonged to them. Because of this everyone was told to evacuate their homes with the view that they would come back when this issue was resolved. When I arrived almost fifty years later the entire beachfront it abandoned and is being looked over by the UN. It is crazy how many people are displaced from normal human living. It is a shame that individuals in this world ruin it for the rest of us by starting wars and causing conflict. It was such a tragedy to look at and it was a no-entry zone meaning you would be shot at the entrance to the site.</p>
