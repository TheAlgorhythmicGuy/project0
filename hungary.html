                <p>Gyor was amazing, however getting there was a bit uncertain as our pickup, burst a tyre before we landed in Budapest. He then proceeded to buy us a bucket of KFC chicken wings which I never knew existed until then, they were delicious, everything tastes better when it is free. We then stayed in this small village in Hungary with my friend and his family it was a great trip we went to a Kingdom Hall which can’t be located using Google Maps. I guess it’s on a need to know basis, not really you can locate it jw.org so that is good.</p>

                <h3>Austria Detour</h3>
                <p>Austria was very fun apart from the fact that they use Euros and not Forint. Exchange rate hurt a little bit but it was definitely worth it. It was a drive that took less than an hour to a waterpark that was full of fun activities. There were three main slides, I can’t remember the other two but the fastest one was called Speedy and rightly so. We used that slide many time because right at the end you would get airtime as is suddenly changed from a 170-degree angle to a 90-degree angle. When we left there we went to a supermarket literally in the middle of nowhere, we bought loads of snack and sweets for the coming days ahead.</p>
